 Class:        GPConfig 
 Date created: 13/09/2002

 The GPConfig is a class which contains a configuration for a particular
 run. Basically it stores pointer to objects which can be customized
 by the user. For example, the user could choose to write their own
 random number generator. To do this they would make a subclass of the
 Random class, create an instance of their new class and set the 
 randomNumGenerator member below to point to the new instance.
 That way any classes that need a random number would use the
 randomNumGenerator to generate random numbers.
