Manage-Config.jar is designed to manage the process of doing multiple runs
for a particular target image. For a particular target image, say 
"my-target.png", we suggest that you have a configuration file called
"my-target.txt".  When you have the parameter values you want, click 
"SAVE TO Painter.txt" (or SAVE TO Mosaic-conf.txt) button to write the
Painter.txt (Mosaic-conf.txt) file for the run. You will then need to
start the npr (or mosaic) program in the usual way from another window.

How to run the jar file: 
In order to run the jar file, you firstly need to install JDK6
(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) on your 
system.  

1. This application consists of the following files, all of which
    must be present: 
    Manage-Config.jar
    quick-help.txt
    help.txt

2. Double click Mange-Config.jar 

3. Use "File/open" to choose your configuration file. 

4. You can find help in the help menu. There is a quick help file
   for frequently used items. 
5. When the value of a parameter is changed, other parameters that are
   not relevant will be grayed out.
6. Enter your input by pressing "enter" button or clicking other
   enabled parameters to validate the new value.  If there are errors, you will find error messages in "error suggestions".
